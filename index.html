Powered by the best technologies 2020 has to offer.\n\nIt's not a a framework or a library, it's a just a simple project that contains some useful utilities and patterns that'll help you hit the ground running. In fact, the [GitHub repo for Devii](https://github.com/colinhacks/devii) contains the code for the site you're currently reading!\n\nDevii doesn't try to be a fully functional blog out of the box. After cloning/forking the repo, you'll need to delete the contents of `index.tsx` (the page you're reading now!) and implement your own homepage. Devii makes it easier — for instance, you can access a list of all your blog posts in `props.posts` — but you still have to build the site you're imagining in your mind's eye.\n\nAnd that's the point! After you clone/fork it, look through this code to learn how Devii works. Then rip out what you don't like, customize everything else, and build your own tools and components on top of the foundation Devii provides!\n\nDevii was designed to place _zero restrictions_ on what your site can be or become. You can use any React component or styling library, pull in data from third-party APIs, even implement user accounts. Your personal website is the online manifestation of you. Don't compromise.\n","features":"It may not look like much, but Devii does a lot out of the box.\n\n**Markdown loading and rendering**: Using Next.js dynamic imports, you can load Markdown files and pass them into your Next.js pages as props. Easy peasy.\n\n**TypeScript + React**: Markdown is great for text-heavy, non-interactive content. For everything else, you'll want something a little more expressive. Devii makes it easy to mix Markdown and React on the same page. Just load your Markdown files with dynamic imports, pass it into your component as a prop, and render it with the `Markdown.tsx` component.\n\n**Built-in support for blogs**: Devii provides a utility for parsing Markdown blog posts with frontmatter metadata into a structured TypeScript object. Supported tags include: `title`, `subtitle`, `datePublished`, `tags`, `description`, `canonicalUrl`, `author`, `authorPhoto`, `authorTwitter`, `bannerPhoto`, and `thumbnailPhoto`\n\n**Medium-inspired styles**: The Markdown components (`Markdown.tsx`) contains default styles inspired by Medium.\n\n**Google Analytics**: Just add your Google Analytics ID (e.g. 'UA-999999999-1') to `globals.ts` and the appropriate snippet will be automatically added to every page.\n\n**RSS feed generation**: An RSS feed is auto-generated from your blog post feed.\n\n**SEO best practices**: Every blog post page automatically populated meta tags based on the post metadata. This includes a `title` tag, `meta` tags, `og:` tags, Twitter metadata, and a `link` tag containing the canonical URL.\n\n**GitHub-style code blocks**: with syntax highlighting powered by [react-syntax-highlighter](https://github.com/conorhastings/react-syntax-highlighter). Works out-of-the-box for all programming languages. Just use Markdown's triple backtick syntax with a \"language identifier\", [just like GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\n\n**Static generation**: you can generate a fully static version of your site using `yarn build \u0026\u0026 yarn export`. Powered by Next.js.\n\n**Zero magic**: You can view and modify every aspect of the site. If you're looking for a starting point, start modifying `index.tsx` (the home page), `BlogPost.tsx` (the blog post template), and `Markdown.tsx` (the Markdown component). And of course you can add entirely new pages/components as well!\n","obombe":"Меня зовут Денис. Я из города Ярославля. Мне 18 лет и я хочу заниматься программированием.

After you clone/fork it, you can look through the code to learn how Devii works. Then you can rip out everything you don't like, customize everything else, and build your own tools and components on top of the foundation Devii provides!\n\nYour personal website is the online manifestation of you. Devii doesn't really provide much out of the box. It provides some nice Medium-style default styles for your blog posts and some tools for loading/rendering Markdown. But you'll have to implement your own homepage more or less from scratch. And that's the point! Don't settle for some theme. Build something that represents you.\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. Fork this repo\n2. ```\n   git clone git@github.com:yourusername/devii.git my-blog\n   cd my-blog\n   yarn\n   ```\n3. Start the development server with `yarn dev`. This should start a server on `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n## Powered by Next.js\n\nThe core of this repo is [Next.js](https://https://nextjs.org). We chose Next.js because it's the simplest, most elegant way to generate a static version of a React-based website. The documentation is excellent; read it first: [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).\n\n## Project structure\n\nHere's is an abbreviated version of the project structure. Certain config files (`next.config.js`, `next-end.d.ts`, `.gitignore`) have been removed for simplicity.\n\n```\n.\n├── README.md\n├── public // all static assets (images, css, etc) go here\n├── pages // every .tsx component in this dir becomes a page of the final site\n|   ├── index.tsx // the home page (which has access to the list of all blog posts)\n|   ├── blog\n|       ├── [blog].md // a template component that renders the blog posts under `/md/blog`\n├── md\n|   ├── blog\n|       ├── devii.md // this page!\n        ├── whatever.md // every MD file in this directory becomes a blog post\n├── components\n|   ├── BlogPost.tsx\n|   ├── Code.tsx\n|   ├── Footer.tsx\n|   ├── Header.tsx\n|   ├── Markdown.tsx\n|   ├── Meta.tsx\n|   ├── \u003cvarious\u003e\n├── loader.ts // contains utility functions for loading/parsing Markdown\n├── node_modules\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── package.json\n```\n\nNext.js generates a new webpage for each file in the `pages` directory. If you want to add an About page to your blog, just add `about.tsx` inside `pages` and start writing the page.\n\nBy default the repo only contains two pages: a home page (`/pages/index.tsx`) and a blog page (`/pages/[blog].md`).\n\nThe file `[blog].ts` follows the Next.js convention of using square brackets to indicate a [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).\n\n## The home page\n\nThe home page is intentionally minimal. You can put whatever you want in `index.tsx`; one of our goals in designing Devii was to place no restrictions on the developer. Use your imagination! Your website is the online manifestion of you. You can use whatever npm packages or styling libraries you like.\n\n## Styling\n\nDevii is unopinionated about styling. Because your Devii site is a standard React app under the hood, you can use your favorite library from `npm` to do styling.\n\nDevii provides certain styles by default, notably in the Markdown renderer (`/components/Markdown.tsx`). Those styles are implemented using Next's built-in styling solution `styled-jsx`. Unfortunately it was necessary to make those styles global, since `styled-jsx` [doesn't play nice](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx/issues/573) with third-party components (in this case `react-markdown`).\n\nFeel free to re-implemement the built-in styles with your library of choice If you choose to use a separate styling library ([emotion](https://emotion.sh/) is pretty glorious) then you could re-implement the default styles\n\n## Adding a new blog post\n\nJust add a Markdown file under `md/blog/` to create a new blog post:\n\n1. Create a new Markdown file called `foo.md` within the `/md/blog` directory\n2. Add in some basic Markdown content\n3. Then go to `http://localhost:3000/blog/foo`. You should see the new post.\n\n## Frontmatter support\n\nEvery Markdown file can include a \"frontmatter block\" containing various metadata. Devii provides a `loadPost` utility that loads a Markdown file, parses it's frontmatter metadata, and returns a structured `PostData` object:\n\n```ts\ntype PostData = {\n  path: string;\n  title?: string;\n  subtitle?: string;\n  description?: string; // used for SEO\n  canonicalUrl?: string; // used for SEO\n  datePublished?: number; // Unix timestamp\n  author?: string;\n  authorPhoto?: string;\n  authorHandle?: string; // twitter handle\n  tags?: string[];\n  bannerPhoto?: string;\n  thumbnailPhoto?: string;\n};\n```\n\nFor example, here is the frontmatter blog from the sample blog post (`md/blog/the-ultimate-tech-stack.md`):\n\n```\n---\ntitle: Introducing Devii\nsubtitle: Bringing the power of React, TypeScript, and static generation to dev blogs everywhere\ndatePublished: 1589064522569\nauthor: Ben Bitdiddle\ntags:\n  - Devii\n  - Blogs\nauthorPhoto: /img/profile.jpg\nbannerPhoto: /img/brook.jpg\nthumbnailPhoto: /img/brook.jpg\n---\n```\n\nView `/loader.ts` to see how this works.\n\n## Google Analytics\n\nJust add your Google Analytics ID (e.g. 'UA-999999999-1') to `globals.ts` and Devii will automatically add the appropriate Google Analytics snippet to your site. Go to `/pages/_app.ts` to see how this works or customize this behavior.\n\n## Medium-inspired design\n\nThe Markdown renderer (`Markdown.tsx`) provides a default style inspired by Medium. Just modify the CSS in `Markdown.tsx` to customize the design to your liking.\n\n## GitHub-style code blocks\n\nYou can easily drop code blocks into your blog posts using triple-backtick syntax ([just like GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)). No more embedding CodePen iframes! 🚀\n\nWorks out-of-the-box for all programming languages. Specify your language with a \"language tag\". So this:\n\n  \u003cpre\u003e\n  ```ts\n  // pretty neat huh?\n  const test = (arg: string) =\u003e {\n    return arg.length \u003e 5;\n  };\n  ```\u003c/pre\u003e\n\nturns into\n\n```ts\n// pretty neat huh?\nconst test = (arg: string) =\u003e {\n  return arg.length \u003e 5;\n};\n```\n\nView `/components/Code.tsx` to see how this works or customize this behavior.\n\n## Markdown loading\n\n_You don't need to understand all of this to use Devii. Consider this an \"advanced guide\" you can use if you want to customize the structure of the site._\n\nMarkdown posts are loaded during Next.js static build step. Check out the [Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) documentation to learn more about this.\n\nHere's the short version: if export a function called `getStaticProps` from one of your page components, Next.js will execute that function, take the result, and pass the `props` property (which should be another object) into your page as props.\n\nYou can dynamically load and parse a Markdown file using `loadMarkdownFile`, a utility function implemented in `loader.ts`. It is an async function that returns a `PostData` TypeScript object containing all the metadata keys listed above:\n\nFor an example of this, check out the `getStaticProps` implementation from the homepage. The function calls `loadBlogPosts` - a utilty function that loads _every_ blog posts in the `/md/blog/` directory, parses them, and returns `PostData[]`.\n\n```ts\nexport const getStaticProps = async () =\u003e {\n  const posts = await loadBlogPosts();\n  return { props: { posts } };\n};\n```\n\nThere are a few utility functions in `loader.ts` that Devii uses. All functions are _async_! All functions accept a _relative_ path which is expected to be \\_relative to the `md/` directory. For instance `loadPost('blog/test.md'`) would load `/md/blog/test.md`.\n\n- `loadPost` loads/parses a Markdown file and returns a `PostData`\n- `loadBlogPosts`: loads/parses all the files in `/md/blog/`. Returns `PostData[]`. Used in `index.tsx` to load/render a list of all published blog posts\n- `loadMarkdownFile`: loads a Markdown file but doesn't parse it. Returns the string content. Useful if you want to implement some parts of a page in Markdown and other parts in React\n- `loadMarkdownFiles`: accepts a [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) pattern and loads all the files inside `/md/` whose names match the pattern. Used internally by `loadBlogPosts`\n\n## Static generation\n\nYou can generate a fully static version of your site using `yarn build \u0026\u0026 yarn export`. This step is entirely powered by Next.js. The static site is exported to the `out` directory.\n\nAfter it's generated, use your static file hosting service of choice (Vercel, Netlify, Firebase Hosting, Amazon S3) to deploy your site.\n\n## Global configs\n\nThere is a `globals.ts` file in the project root containing some settings/configuration metadata about your site:\n\n- `yourName`: Your name, used for the copyright tags in the footer and the RSS feed, e.g. Alyssa P. Hacker\n- `siteName`: The title of your blog, e.g. `Alyssa's Cool Blog`;\n- `siteDescription`: A short description, used in the `meta` description tag, e.g. 'I write about code \\'n stuff';\n- `siteCreationDate`: Used in the generated RSS feed. Use this format: 'March 3, 2020 04:00:00 GMT';\n- `twitterHandle`: The twitter handle for you or your blog/company, used in the Twitter meta tags. Include the @ symbol, e.g. '@alyssaphacker';\n- `email`: Your email, used as the \"webMaster\" and \"managingEditor\" field of the generated RSS feed, e.g. `alyssa@example.com`;\n- `url`: The base URL of your website, used to \"compute\" default canonical links from relative paths, e.g. 'https://alyssaphacker.com';\n- `accentColor`: The header and footer background color, e.g. `#4fc2b4`;\n\n## RSS feed generation\n\nAn RSS feed is auto-generated from your blog post feed. This feed is generated using the `rss` module (for converting JSON to RSS format) and `showdown` for converting the markdown files to RSS-compatible HTML.\n\nFor RSS generation to work, all your posts must contain a `datePublished` timestamp in their frontmatter metadata. To examine or customize the RSS generation, check out the `rssUtil.ts` file in the root directory.\n\n## SEO\n\nEvery blog post page automatically populated meta tags based on the post metadata. This includes a `title` tag, `meta` tags, `og:` tags, Twitter metadata, and a `link` tag containing the canonical URL.\n\nThe default value of the canonical URL is computed by concatenating the value of your `url` config (see Global Configs above) and the relative path of your post. Verify that the canonical URL is exactly equivalent to the URL in the browser when visiting your live site, otherwise your site's SEO may suffer.\n\n## Insanely customizable\n\nThere's nothing \"under the hood\" here. You can view and modify all the files that provide the functionality listed above. Devii just provides a project scaffold, some Markdown-loading loading utilities (in `loader.ts`), and some sensible styling defaults (especially in `Markdown.tsx`).\n\nTo get started customizing, check out the source code of `index.tsx` (the home page), `BlogPost.tsx` (the blog post template), and `Markdown.tsx` (the Markdown renderer).\n\nHead to the GitHub repo to get started: [https://github.com/colinhacks/devii](https://github.com/colinhacks/devii).

Check out the HN \u003cdel\u003eroast\u003c/del\u003e discussion \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23309002\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e! 🤗\n\nI recently set out to build my personal website — the one you're reading now, as it happens!\n\nSurprisingly, it was much harder than expected to put together a \"tech stack\" that met my criteria. My criteria are pretty straightforward; I would expect most React devs to have a similar list. Yet it was surprisingly hard to put all these pieces together.\n\nGiven the lack of a decent out-of-the-box solution, I worry that many developers are settling for static-site generators that place limits on the interactivity and flexibility of your website. We can do better.\n\n\u003e Clone the repo here to get started with this setup: https://github.com/colinhacks/devii\n\nLet's quickly run through my list of design goals:\n\n### React (+ TypeScript)\n\nI want to build the site with React and TypeScript. I love them both wholeheartedly, I use them for my day job, and they're gonna be around for a long time. Plus writing untyped JS makes me feel dirty.\n\nI don't want limitations on what my personal website can be/become. Sure, at present my site consists of two simple, static blog posts. But down the road, I may want to build a page that contains an interactive visualization, a filterable table, or a demo of a React component I'm open-sourcing. Even something simple (like the email newsletter signup form at the bottom of this page) was much more pleasant to implement in React; how did we use to build forms again?\n\nPlus: I want access to the npm ecosystem and all my favorite UI, animation, and styling libraries. I sincerely hope I never write another line of raw CSS ever again; CSS-in-JS 4 lyfe baby. If you want to start a Twitter feud with me about this, by all means [at me](https://twitter.com/colinhacks).\n\n### Good authoring experience\n\nIf it's obnoxious to write new blog posts, I won't do it. That's a regrettable law of the universe. Even writing blog posts with plain HTML — just a bunch of `\u003cp\u003e` tags in a div — is just annoying enough to bug me. The answer: Markdown of course!\n\nStatic site generators (SSGs) like Hugo and Jekyll provide an undeniably wonderful authoring experience. All you have to do is `touch` a new .md file in the proper directory and get to writing. Unfortunately all Markdown-based SSGs I know of are too restrictive. Mixing React and Markdown on the same page is either impossible or tricky. If it's possible, it likely requires some plugin/module/extension, config file, blob of boilerplate, or egregious hack. Sorry Hugo, I'm not going to re-write my React code using `React.createElement` like it's 2015.\n\nWell, that doesn't work for me. I want my website to be React-first, with a sprinkling of Markdown when it makes my life easier.\n\n### Static generation\n\nAs much as I love the Jamstack, it doesn't cut it from an SEO perspective. Many blogs powered by a \"headless CMS\" require two round trips before rendering the blog content (one to fetch the static JS bundle and another to fetch the blog content from a CMS). This degrades page load speeds and user experience, which accordingly degrades your rankings on Google.\n\nInstead I want every page of my site to be pre-rendered to a set of fully static assets, so I can deploy them to a CDN and get fast page loads everywhere. You could get the same benefits with server-side rendering, but that requires an actual server and worldwide load balancing to achieve comparable page load speeds. I love overengineering things as much as the next guy, even I have a line. 😅\n\n## My solution\n\nI describe my final architecture design below, along with my rationale for each choice. I distilled this setup into a website starter/boilerplate available here: https://github.com/colinhacks/devii. Below, I allude to certain files/functions I implemented; to see the source code of these, just clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:colinhacks/devii.git`\n\n### Next.js\n\nI chose to build my site with Next.js. This won't be a surprising decision to anyone who's played with statically-rendered or server-side rendered React in recent years. Next.js is quickly eating everyone else's lunch in this market, especially Gatsby's (sorry Gatsby fans).\n\nNext.js is by far the most elegant way (for now) to do any static generation or server-side rendering with React. They just released their next-generation (pun intended) static site generator in the [9.3 release](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3) back in March. So in the spirit of using technologies [in the spring of their life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBAX8MbRYFA), Next.js is a no-brainer.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of the project structure. No need to understand every piece of it; but it may be useful to refer to throughout the rest of this post.\n\n```\n.\n├── README.md\n├── public // all static files (images, etc) go here\n├── pages // every .tsx component in this dir becomes a page of the final site\n|   ├── index.tsx // the home page (which has access to the list of all blog posts)\n|   ├── blog\n|       ├── [blog].md // a template component that renders the blog posts under `/md/blog`\n├── md\n|   ├── blog\n|       ├── devii.md // this page!\n        ├── whatever.md // every MD file in this directory becomes a blog post\n├── components\n|   ├── Code.tsx\n|   ├── Markdown.tsx\n|   ├── \u003cvarious others\u003e\n├── loader.ts // contains utility functions for loading/parsing Markdown\n├── node_modules\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── package.json\n├── next.config.js\n├── next-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n```\n\n\u003c!-- Check out the Next.js documentation [here](https://nextjs.org/docs) to make sure it's the right choice for your project. --\u003e\n\n### TypeScript + React\n\nBoth React and TypeScript are baked into the DNA of Next.js, so you get these for free when you set up a Next.js project.\n\nGatsby, on the other hand, has a special plugin for TypeScript support, but it's not officially supported and seems to be [low on their priority list](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/18983). Also, after messing with it for an hour I couldn't get it to play nice with hot reload.\n\n### Markdown authoring\n\nUsing Next's special `getStaticProps` hook and glorious [dynamic imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import#with-no-ssr), it's trivial to a Markdown file and pass its contents into your React components as a prop. This achieves the holy grail I was searching for: the ability to easily mix React and Markdown.\n\n#### Frontmatter support\n\nEvery Markdown file can include a \"frontmatter block\" containing metadata. I implemented a simple utility function (`loadPost`) that loads a Markdown file, parses its contents, and returns a TypeScript object with the following signature:\n\n```ts\ntype PostData = {\n  path: string; // the relative URL to this page, can be used as an href\n  content: string; // the body of the MD file\n  title?: string;\n  subtitle?: string;\n  date?: number;\n  author?: string;\n  authorPhoto?: string;\n  authorTwitter?: string;\n  tags?: string[];\n  bannerPhoto?: string;\n  thumbnailPhoto?: string;\n};\n```\n\nI implemented a separate function `loadPosts` that loads _all_ the Markdown files under `/md/blog` and returns them as an array (`PostData[]`). I use `loadPosts` on this site's home page to render a list of all posts I've written.\n\n### Medium-inspired design\n\nI used the wonderful [`react-markdown`](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown) package to render Markdown as a React component. My Markdown rendered component (`/components/Markdown.tsx`) provides some default styles inspired by Medium's design. Just modify the `style` pros in `Markdown.tsx` to customize the design to your liking.\n\n### GitHub-style code blocks\n\nYou can easily drop code blocks into your blog posts using triple-backtick syntax. Specify the programming language with a \"language tag\", [just like GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)!\n\nTo achieve this I implemented a custom `code` renderer (`/components/Code.tsx`) for `react-markdown` that uses [react-syntax-highlighter](https://github.com/conorhastings/react-syntax-highlighter#readme) to handle the highlighting. So this:\n\n\u003c!-- I landed on this solution after wasting hours playing with other options. CodeMirror has bad React support (the only React wrapper for it is inauspiciously named `react-codemirror2`) and [bizarre selection issues](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues/1099) for `readonly` code blocks. The popular `highlight.js` project requires you to [initialize the library](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues/925) in `componentDidMount` like its 2015 :/  --\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\n```ts\n// pretty neat huh?\nconst test = (arg: string) =\u003e {\n  return arg.length \u003e 5;\n};\n```\u003c/pre\u003e\n\nturns into this:\n\n```ts\n// pretty neat huh?\nconst test = (arg: string) =\u003e {\n  return arg.length \u003e 5;\n};\n```\n\n### RSS feed generation\n\nAn RSS feed is auto-generated from your blog post feed. This feed is generated using the `rss` module (for converting JSON to RSS format) and `showdown` for converting the markdown files to RSS-compatible HTML. The feed is generated during the build step and written as a static file to `/rss.xml` in your static assets folder. It's dead simple. That's the joy of being able to easily write custom build scripts on top of Next.js's `getStaticProps` hooks!\n\n### SEO\n\nEvery blog post page automatically populated meta tags based on the post metadata. This includes a `title` tag, `meta` tags, `og:` tags, Twitter metadata, and a `link` tag containing the canonical URL. You can modify/augment this in the `PostMeta.ts` component.\n\n### Static generation\n\nYou can generate a fully static version of your site using `yarn build \u0026\u0026 yarn export`. This step is entirely powered by Next.js. The static site is exported to the `out` directory.\n\nAfter its generated, use your static file hosting service of choice (Firebase Hosting, Vercel, Netlify) to deploy your site.\n\n### Insanely customizable\n\nThere's nothing \"under the hood\" here. You can view and modify all the files that provide the functionality described above. Devii just provides a project scaffold, some Markdown-loading loading utilities (in `loader.ts`), and some sensible styling defaults (especially in `Markdown.tsx`).\n\nTo start customizing, modify `index.tsx` (the home page), `Essay.tsx` (the blog post template), and `Markdown.tsx` (the Markdown renderer).\n\n## Get started\n\nHead to the GitHub repo to get started: [https://github.com/colinhacks/devii](https://github.com/colinhacks/devii).
